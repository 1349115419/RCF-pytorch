### Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/yun-liu">yun-liu's</a> help.
Created by XuanyiLi, if you have any problem in using it, please contact:xuanyili.edu@gmail.com.
The best result of my pytorch model is *** ODS F-score now.
#### my model result
the following are the side outputs and the prediction example

### Introduction
I implement the edge detection model according to the <a href="https://github.com/yun-liu/rcf">RCF</a>  model in pytorch. 

the result of my pytorch model will be released in the future

| Method |ODS F-score on BSDS500 dataset |ODS F-score on NYU Depth dataset|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|ours| 0.764(epoch10) | *** |
| Reference[1]| 0.806  | ***  |


### Installation

Install <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a>. The code is tested under 0.4.1 GPU version and Python 3.6  on Ubuntu 16.04. There are also some dependencies for a few Python libraries for data processing and visualizations like `cv2` etc. It's highly recommended that you have access to GPUs.

### Usage

#### image edge detection

To train a HED model on BSDS500:

        python train_RCF.py

If you have multiple GPUs on your machine, you can also run the multi-GPU version training:

        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train_multi_gpu.py --num_gpus 2

After training, to evaluate:

        python evaluate.py (for further work)

### Updates

### To do 
* Add support for multi-gpu training for the edge detetion task.
* Improve the performance to 0.782 in the original paper.
* Add a gpu version of edge-eval code to accelerate the evaluation process.
